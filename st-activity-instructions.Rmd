### Get familiar with the data we have

We should see we have four samples, a metadata file, as well as a PDF of the manuscript that describes these data.

Each sample's folder has an h5 file, and a spatial folder.

- sample_093d
  - GSM6433590_093D_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5
  - spatial
    - GSM6433590_093D_scalefactors_json.json
    - GSM6433590_093D_tissue_hires_image.png
    - GSM6433590_093D_tissue_positions_list.csv
- sample_396a
  ...
- sample_396c
  ...
- sample_397d
  ...

The README describes these samples:

> The original data set results from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor biopsies collected from a diverse patient cohort. Patients underwent different therapeutic regimes. The tumor biopsies were profiled with 10X Visium. The data set presented here is a subset of the original cohort.

Additionally the metadata describe which samples came from which patients with which treatments which looks like this:

|samplename|patient|therapy|
|----------|-------|-------|
|sample_093d|patient_12|none
|sample_396a|patient_19|pembrolizumab
|sample_396c|patient_20|adriamycin
|sample_397d|patient_22|taxotere

<input type="checkbox"> Go to https://spatialge.moffitt.org/
<input type="checkbox"> Click on "Sign Up" in the upper right corner.

## Starting a new project

<input type="checkbox"> Click the blue "New Project" button
<input type="checkbox"> For `What spatial transcriptomics platform are you using for this project?` choose `Visium` -- this is the type of data our example data are.
<input type="checkbox"> Make your own project name and description that's sensible. Could be something related to the workshop "ITN workshop"
<input type="checkbox"> Then click "Create".

## Uploading samples

For each sample we will repeat the following steps:


<input type="checkbox"> For `Sample Name` put the ID indicating on the folder, i.e. `sample_093d`
